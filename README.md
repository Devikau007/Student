## Project: Student intervention system
##project description
 Project aims to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. This is done by analyzing the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
